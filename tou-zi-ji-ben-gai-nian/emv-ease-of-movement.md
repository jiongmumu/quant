# EMV - Ease of Movement



There are three parts to the EMV formula: distance moved, volume and the high-low range. First, the distance moved is calculated by comparing the current period's midpoint with the prior period's midpoint, which is the high plus the low divided by two. Distance moved is positive when the current midpoint is above the prior midpoint and negative when the current midpoint is below the prior midpoint. Distance moved is shown as the numerator in the formula below.

```text
Distance Moved = ((H + L)/2 - (Prior H + Prior L)/2) 
Box Ratio = ((V/100,000,000)/(H - L))
1-Period EMV = ((H + L)/2 - (Prior H + Prior L)/2) / ((V/100,000,000)/(H - L))
14-Period Ease of Movement = 14-Period simple moving average of 1-period EMV
